                <p>Like many, I have trouble thinking about what I want to do in the future. 
                Even though I plan to study engineering, I sometimes come back to different pathway ideas. 
                So I thought to myself, "If I can't choose one, why not just do it all?" 
                And that was what lead me to try out a gazillion things and have 3 million hobbies.

                If you're like me, you're probably trying to figure your way through life, or figure out 
                what life is. Sometimes, the most unexpected events occur and in those moments,
                you've never wished more that you understood what life is.
                I too wish I knew what life is so you know what? Let's find out.</p>
