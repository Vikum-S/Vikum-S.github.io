                    <h3>Hi! I'm Vikum Semage, a high school student from Milton, Ontario!</h3>
                    <p>I enjoy learning. My hobbies include but are not limited to: Guitar, Music Production, and Taekwondo.     
                    I also have a passion towards cars and hope to study engineering after high school. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, listening to music, and playing video games. 
                    I wouldn't really consider myself "the best" at anything, but I'd rather push to be "pretty good" at many things. 
                    </p>
